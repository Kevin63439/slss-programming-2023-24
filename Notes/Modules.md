Modules are bits of code that we can use in Python 
These bits of code aren't automatically included, so we need to import them
into our code

# The time module
time allows us to play around with anything related to time.
We can pause our code using time.

```python
import time

#pause code for 1 second.
time.sleep(1)
```

# Import
The import keyword loads the module into our file
imports should be at the **top of the file** under the **header**
