In Python, data can be grouped in categories called Types

| Name    | Example     |
| ---         | ---              |
| string   | "hello"       |
| list        | [1,2,3,4]    |
| integers or int | 1  -10 23 |
| float  | 3.5 -3.5 1.0 |
| Boolean or bool | True False |

An example of using these types of data:

```python
favourite_food = "tempura" #string
my_age = 16.0 #float
```
